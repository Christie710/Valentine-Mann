# 💖 Valentine Website Project for Mann

## 🎯 Goal
Create a visually stunning, interactive Valentine’s Day website using **React** and **Three.js (React Three Fiber)**.

The website is a romantic, magical experience to ask my girlfriend **Mann** to be my Valentine.  
It must feel emotional, playful, cinematic, slightly dramatic, and creatively maximalist — not minimal.

This should feel like a love confession in digital form.
